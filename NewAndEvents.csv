"<p>Industry leader WALTER Surface Technologies, providing metalworking solutions for more than 60 years, has formulated an innovative and cost-effective solution to nozzle spatter build-up with the NEW E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES™.</p>  <p><strong>Launching at FABETCH 2021, the new E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES™, the only pre-coated MIG nozzles on the market, reduce downtime spent scraping out spatter and slag by a unique and innovative water-based ceramic coating.</strong></p>  <p>Five times longer lasting welding nozzles, the new E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES™ provide a safe solution to nozzle spatter build-up, while increasing productivity and reducing consumable expenses.</p>  <p>Through this acquisition, Walter adds a unique personal protective equipment product line to its offering, complementing both its high-end metalworking products and its workplace safety seminar program.</p>  <p>&quot;&quot;It took over 2 years of research and multiple failures to refine this unique ceramic solution and create an application process that offers exceptional durability to our welding nozzles. We are proud to bring to the market a product that respects the spirit of Walter Surface Technologies by helping our customers to work better and safer&quot;&quot; says Philip Laforest, R&amp;D Product Manager.</p>  <p>The formation of spatter is a time-consuming challenge frequently faced by welders &amp; automated robotic welding. In MIG welding applications, spatter not only adheres to work pieces, but also clogs MIG gun’s nozzle. The new E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES™ are made of high-quality copper with a unique ceramic coating on both the interior and exterior surface that prevents spatter from adhering to the nozzle. This prevents nozzle obstruction, allowing shielding gas to flow freely for higher quality welds.</p>  <p>The highly concentrated ceramic coating is also highly durable for long-lasting protection against thermal damage. This also provides these nozzles with a life span up to 5 times longer than standard OEM nozzles. The new E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES™ provide a cost-effective way to keep up production, achieve high-quality welds and reduce nozzle changeover.</p>  <p>Pre-coated nozzles are permanently coated with a safe, water-based ceramic solution which saves end-users a lot of time. Aerosol sprays and gels must be re-applied throughout the welding process, the torch has to cool down before re-applying aerosol solutions and the solution must dry before beginning to weld. Many aerosols are also solvent based, flammable, and therefore cannot be used on many job sites. The new E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES™ are safe for all welding applications.</p>  <p>The new E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES™ are available in various sizes and models compatible with Miller®, Lincoln® and Tregaskiss® welding equipment. Without any modification or adaptors.</p>  <p><em>Visit WALTER Surface Technologies at FABTECH at booth B35060 in the Welding Pavilion to learn more about the NEW E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES™ and discover their full line of metalworking solutions.</em></p>  <p><strong>E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES ™</strong><br> • Reduce downtime scraping spatter and replacing nozzles<br> • Prevents nozzle obstructions resulting in a higher quality weld<br> • Lasts up to 5 times longer than standard OEM nozzles<br> • No dry-time compared to other aerosol coatings<br> • Safe &amp; non-flammable solution to nozzle spatter build-up.</p>  <p>Video link: <a href="""" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/uQBbrCF8YxA</a>.</p>  <p>Product Sheet: <a href="""" target=""_blank"">https://bit.ly/3EaarsY</a>.</p>",WALTER Surface Technologies Launches Innovative Solution to Nozzle Spatter Build-up: The New E-WELD PRE-COATED NOZZLES ™,News,2024-12-31T17:00:00.000Z,a1sO40000008S3xIAE,https://waltersurfacetechnologies--rundtc.sandbox.file.force.com/sfc/dist/version/download/?oid=00D7A0000000oxS&ids=068O4000000SOaT&d=%2Fa%2FO4000000639h%2FGBiwXWL5rR6fluwLtiLOQDQCoSp4Do9N.ClZGNUJ4Hw&asPdf=false,TRUE,TRUE,WALTER Surface Technologies Launches Innovative Solution to Nozzle Spatter Build,2023-12-29T17:00:00.000Z,0ZEO9000002S0ojOAC,Walter-EN_CA,Innovative,a1Z7A000001YcEfUAK,EN_CA,a2EO9000000CH6jMAG,EN_CA

"<p><strong>Montreal, Quebec, January 28th, 2024</strong> - In its quest to become a global leader for productivity and safety solutions in the metalworking industry, WALTER Surface Technologies has launched three exclusive new technologies to further maximize life of its high-performance ceramic abrasives.</p><p>“Ceramic grains provide longer life, higher removal rates and improve comfort for operators,” says Marc Brunet Gagné, Senior Product Manager, Abrasive Power Tools. “But, it takes more than just the grain to build a high-performance abrasive wheel. WALTER has gone beyond the grain with new exclusive technologies to ensure that the ceramic grain is optimized and performs at its best!”</p><p><strong>SMART RESIN™ TECHNOLOGY</strong></p><p>WALTER’s exclusive SMART RESIN™ Technology, found in bonded abrasives such as the ZIP™ XX and the XCAVATOR XX™, works to expose fresh ceramic grains at the optimal moment to achieve the most productive balance between sharpness &amp; life in a metalworker’s given application.</p><p><strong>V-STONG™ BACKING TECHNOLOGY</strong></p><p>WALTER’s exclusive V-STRONG™ Backing Technology, found in its ceramic sanding discs such as the XTRACUT™ and the COOLCUT XX™, improves durability and toughness of the wheel thanks to stronger resistance of the cloth. “With 14% more vulcanized fiber in the cloth than competitors, WALTER ceramic sanding discs last longer, resulting is less wheel changeover,” adds Brunet Gagné.</p><p><strong>MAX LIFE™ GLUE</strong>  </p><p>&quot;Most flap discs are baked during the manufacturing process to bond the flaps to the backing. Unfortunately, this process can dry out the backing cloth of the flaps, reducing its performance,&quot; explains Brunet Gagné. Now, thanks to WALTER&#39;s exclusive MAX LIFE™ cold curing glue, WALTER ensures the freshest abrasives possible on products such as the ENDURO-FLEX™ TURBO, to avoid micro-cracking and drying out, which improves consistency, and can extend disc life by up to 25%.</p><p>WALTER’s new grain-enhancing technologies are now available on all its ceramic abrasive solutions.
